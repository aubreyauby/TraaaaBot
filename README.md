<h1>TraaaaBot (disc.)</h1>
<h3>This project has been discontinued. It is now open-source for historical purposes and the bot is no longer in operation.</h3>
<p>The bot's token has been (mistakenly) published, but the entire bot from the Discord Developer portal has been deleted way before I initially turned this into open-source. When running this code under the token it ran under, you aren't overriding or interfering with any active bots.</p>
<p>I am no longer overseeing this project. If you have questions or don't know how things work, I advise you to look up information online for research. No documentation for this project will be made.</p>

  <h2>Original description</h2>
  <p>
    A multi-purpose Discord bot written in discord.js that focuses on moderation, server management, and fun commmands for the public. The name originated from the idea that Traaaanns Hangout on Discord had many bots that have become unusable due their frequent outages and lack of features that are crucial for the server. This bot is a hobby project that aims to fix those problems, and has expanded to serve other communities as well. Servers who use TraaaaBot are also acknowledging that their server is a safe space for the trans community. The bot has been written independently by electrasys (now aubreyauby) with JavaScript.
